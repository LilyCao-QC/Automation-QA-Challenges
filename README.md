Hello there, 

I wrote some test scripts in the Katalon framework. Please perform the following steps to run the scripts:

  a. Install Katalon Studio: see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yyjvea9nMZw&list=PLhW3qG5bs-L_D4ZePNNjvmIULuu6mBHbu&index=2
  
  b. Get the codes from on https://github.com/LilyCao-QC/Automation-QA-Challenges/tree/master
  
  c. The following are the instructions for running the test scripts: See 'Execute test script in Katalon.mp4' for more information.
